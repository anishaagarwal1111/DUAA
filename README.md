With 1/3rd of the population going to becoming urban by 2050 has popped up significant challenges for many countries, especially India. The majority of rural people have also started to relocate themselves to cities seeking jobs and new livelihood. These have made cities prone to natural calamities and disaster, making people homeless on a massive scale. 
Thus, the sustainable development of cities with affordable and safe housing has become more pivotal than ever. Providing safe and permanent housing solutions for everyone is now necessary.
