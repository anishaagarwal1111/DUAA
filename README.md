# Problem
With 1/3rd of the population going to becoming urban by 2050 has popped up significant challenges for many countries, especially India. The majority of rural people have also started to relocate themselves to cities seeking jobs and new livelihood. These have made cities prone to natural calamities and disaster, making people homeless on a massive scale. 
Thus, the sustainable development of cities with affordable and safe housing has become more pivotal than ever. Providing safe and permanent housing solutions for everyone is now necessary.

  Sustainable development of cities with affordable and safe housing for everyone, even the new migrants.



# **Long description**
The world is undergoing a colossal wave of urban growth in history. With more than half of the world's population now living in cities and town, this wave will only grow now. If we talk about some stats, from 1950 to 2010, more than 2 billion people lived in cities, and by 2050 the population living in the cities in developing countries would increase by two folds.

Data collected from a sample of 911 cities from 114 countries in 2020 show that, through the 1990-2019 period, spatial urbanization is happening much faster than population growth, and smaller cities are urbanizing more rapidly than bigger ones. And with the onset of Covid-19, the fast pace of urbanization means that cities must find new solutions to different problems like overcrowding, pollution, housing shortages, and underfunded public services. 

If we leave the pandemic aside, cities across the world experienced rising slum dweller populations, worsening air pollution, minimal open public spaces and limited convenient access to public transport. Over the years, the number of slum dwellers continued to grow, reaching over 1 billion in 2018.


If we talk just about India, we are urbanizing rapidly. Between 2001 and 2011, the urban population of our country has increased by 91 million. India is projected to add 416 million urban dwellers between 2018 and 2050. Currently, 68% of India's total population live in rural areas, while 17% of the urban population live in slums. 


### The Solution:


We will collect data on migration within the country through various mediums such as government organisations(Census, train tickets, labour unions), NGOs and voluntary data collection.

Further, we will find out the area where the majority of immigrants come looking for jobs, education or for any other reason.

After identifying the potential area, we will chalk out the plan of action to help the cities cope up and provide a solution for new migrants to have better housing facilities and not live in slums.

Submit the insights and solution to the government and through their help, work on the plan to have a sustainable development of the city and better housing conditions for migrants and currently people living in slums.

We have developed a portal on which people can register the place where they are migrating. There are resources on the portal for housing, emergency services and many more services for the potential areas.
